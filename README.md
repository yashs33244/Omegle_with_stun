This error typically occurs due to version mismatches or incomplete installation of Tailwind CSS with Vite. Let's fix this step by step:

1. First, let's remove the existing Tailwind installation and node_modules:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules
rm package-lock.json
```

2. Now, install the correct versions of Tailwind CSS and its dependencies:

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest @tailwindcss/vite@latest
```

3. Create or update your Tailwind configuration file (tailwind.config.js):

```bash
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

4. Update the tailwind.config.js content:

```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

5. Make sure your src/index.css contains the Tailwind directives:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

6. Update your vite.config.ts:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    react(),
    tailwindcss()
  ],
})
```

7. Finally, reinstall all dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

8. Start your development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

If you're still experiencing issues, you can try clearing your npm cache:

```bash
npm cache clean --force
```

The error `_.waitForRequestsIdle is not a function` often indicates a problem with the Tailwind CSS plugin for Vite. Making sure all packages are at their latest compatible versions should resolve this issue.
